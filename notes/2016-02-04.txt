TODO:

  1. handle minor site changes with safe URL list and site_mod flag
  2. minimum training requests, given successful handling of minor site changes
  3. why are exploit attempts getting blocked?
  4. fix sticky user level


Blocks by category:

   admin user level is occasionally sticky in the session, causing ambiguous user level
    assignment, especially for entry points to admin pages where cookie-login eventually occurs
   when something trivial in the site changes, a few new edges may occur. Try this:
     establish some list of trusted URLs
       never blocked
       always execute code from the same "URL cfg"
       never crosses admin boundary
     when a code change occurs in a request to a trusted URL:
       isolate the new edges and user level changes
       try to guess if a recent DB/filesystem update may be related to the code change
       if we decide it's safe, add these edges to the dataset
         log the update, including reasons for approval
       if we decide it's not safe (yet), block the request
         can still approve the code later, e.g. if enough safe URLs try to use it


Safe URLs

   All URLs during training are considered safe.
     Manually remove suspicious URLs?
   For any request that does not invoke any new code, add the URL to the safe list.
   When the site changes, set a "flex" flag on each safe URL
   For each request to a URL with "flex" enabled:
     Evaluate the request for safe-looking behavior:
       Executes a reasonable amount of new code
         Accesses the modified table?
       Does not change user level where it did not before
       Does not modify app state (DB/filesystem) where it did not before
     If the request still looks safe:
       Add all new edges to the dataset
     Disable the "flex" flag for that URL

  * Issues

   How to handle a new post? It potentially introduces a new URL together with new code. Options:
     Handle it as a major site change and require offline retraining.
     Instrument the site's PHP to register the new URL with ScriptSafe, which makes it safe.
     Infer that a new URL is safe if it occurs after a (relatable?) site change.
       Rely on past experience with new URLs.


New PHP files

   If the site generates PHP files, catalog the safe code generators.
   If the site accepts uploads, catalog the safe upload path (with user level).
   When a safe file creation path is observed, mark the new file as safe.

  * Issues:

   How much to trust requests that invoke code in the new PHP file?
   What about changes to site data in the file tree? Some sites may write to those files on every request,
    for example to track internal statistics. Maybe we only count the change as flex for requests that
    actually load the changed data, whether from DB or file or anywhere else.

 ==== Safe file generators

   fopen, fwrite and file_put_contents are defined in here:
     ext/standard/basic_functions.c
   file_put_contents takes a path arg, so we know the file immediately
   fwrite takes a handle that comes from fopen()
     the handle is a zend_resource (Zend/zend_types.php:189), which only has the filesystem handle
     looks like the easy way to get the file path is to just catalog all the fopen calls
   uploads generally use php/ext/curl, which directly calls libc fwrite()

  --- gitlist

   the template is always generated on exactly the same call stack
   twig/symfony are using file_put_contents(), so we have the filename in hand
