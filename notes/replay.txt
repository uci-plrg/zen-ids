To replay gor logs:

1. Get gor
    Build from plrg repository if necessary--instructions in /BUILD.txt
2. Unpack the logs somewhere
    Number the logs sequentially for easy iteration
3. Reset the database
    Delete whatever is there
    Change all URLs in the DB init script to the replay server
    Run the DB init script
4. Reset the site files if necessary
    Delete the site tree
    Unpack the original site tree
    Patch the PHP code with replay authentication hooks (e.g. WordPress)
5. Set up a merge area having nothing in it
6. Delete the dataset from a while ago: $datasets/$app.set
7. Delete the error and access logs in /var/log/apache2
8. Replay the logs like this:
     $gor
       --input-file "log.gor|i"
       --output-sync-http "http://dw-7.eecs.uci.edu"
       --output-http-redirects=100
       --output-http-url-exclude "\.edu/git|\.edu/publications|\.edu/software|\.edu/admin"
9. After each replay batch:
    Make a $run directory
    Move the apache error and access logs into $run
    Merge:
       w-merge -o $merge_output $(ls -d $(sr -w 1)/*/$app)
       Copy the merge result files into $run
       Copy the cfg.set file to $datasets/sets/$app.set

Notes

1. If the authentication is not working, use PHP function `error_log($message)` to debug.
