 === zend_op (instruction)

  zend_op is defined as _zend_op in zend_compile.h
  a zend_op has two operands (op1 and op2, struct znode_op), each with a type (op1_type and op2_type)
  a zend_op has one result (struct znode_op) with a type result_type (uninitialized if not used)
  a znode_op is interpreted according to its corresponding type
  the op[12]_type and result_type have domain (from zend_compile.h):
    #define IS_CONST         (1<<0)  /* Constant (op[12].zv has some constant value type)
    #define IS_TMP_VAR       (1<<1)  /* Stack variable (op[12].var is an offset in execute_data to a `zval *`) */
    #define IS_VAR           (1<<2)  /* Variable (op[12].var is an offset in execute_data to a `zval *`) */
    #define IS_UNUSED        (1<<3)  /* Unused variable */
    #define IS_CV            (1<<4)  /* Compiled variable (op[12].var is an offset in execute_data to a `zval *`) */
    #define EXT_TYPE_UNUSED	 (1<<5)  /* Return value unused (not applicable to src operands) */
  note: in some cases an IS_CONST operand may have a direct op[12].constant value. This seems to occur only
         for literals, and is often elided during compilation via constant folding

 === zval (operand)

  zval is defined as _zval_struct in zend_types.h
  the zval->value is interpreted according to its type
  the zval->u1.v.type has domain (from zend_types.h):
    #define IS_UNDEF          0
    #define IS_NULL           1
    #define IS_FALSE          2
    #define IS_TRUE           3
    #define IS_LONG           4
    #define IS_DOUBLE         5
    #define IS_STRING         6
    #define IS_ARRAY          7
    #define IS_OBJECT         8
    #define IS_RESOURCE       9
    #define IS_REFERENCE      10

 === local variables

  the zend_execute_data (hardcoded in macros as `execute_data`) contains a list of local variables
  for znode_op of type var (IS_TMP_VAR, IS_VAR, IS_CV), the znode_op.var points into the execute_data
  the variable's `zval *` is found in the list using, e.g., `EX_VAR(op1.var)`, which expands to:
     ((zval*)(((char*)(execute_data)) + ((int)(op1.var))))


 === handlers

  the implementation of each opcode is in zend_vm_execute.h
  this source file is generated from the much more readable zend_vm_def.h


 === dataflow effects

   `include` and `require` propagate locals!
   arrays and objects:
     global state may always affect an l-value
     statically declared r-value can be definite (required to be deeply static?)
   type-dependent operations are only certain for statically declared types in
    control flow paths that are static and certainly reached
   dynamic execution and function definition can only be certain for static source
   given complete knowledge about the inputs to any op, we an always compute its effects
   static compututation of some ops depends on whether the program uses any indeterminate assignments:
     computing global variables: all global assignments must use statically determinate variables
     computing maps:
       all map modifications must use statically determinate keys and values
       control flow in map operations must be statically determinate
    -> rare for these ops to be statically determinate
    -> may hypothesize a particular value and then proceed with analysis

 === things to model

   SQL:
     operation type: {insert, update, delete}
     source/destination table
     referenced tables
   functions
     sources affecting the sinks (return value, globals and I/O)
       args
       globals
       input (files, db, system)
     sinks
       globals
       output (page, files, db, system)
   object structures
     identify roots
     identify each object's relationship to its root(s)

 === global binding

   any variable can be bound into global space (or unbound from it) at any time
   is it safe to say for any variable that if it is not usually bound to a global,
    then it is probably never bound to a global?
