  Create a dataset from:
    a merge of all the requests
    the first n requests

Maybe like this:

1. load the base dataset, if any
    merge the run's routines into the base?
      maybe with all user levels at 0?
2. merge the datasets/runs into a copy, which becomes the routine/node source
3. sort the requests chronologically, starting from the first request not in the base (if any)
4. iterate the requests
    pull new routines from the source
    add request edges to the base
5. write the graph to a new dataset

Then iterate the remaining requests and log any edges outside the dataset (alarms).
